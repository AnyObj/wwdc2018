# wwdc2018
The project is the playground I've submitted for the WWDC 2018 scholarship application.
Its main objective is to demistify the AI by showing how a neural network works with a tiny model.

The nodes of the network are associated with characters and arcs are associated with the trust they have in eachother. The network can then be trained to give out specific results, so that the user can experiment, see what can be the outputs of a specific training and even dig into the code, where i have written and documented the whole Neural Network's logic.



UI is not perfect, i know, but i had not enough time to make it better. Maybe I will update it in the future! 😁
